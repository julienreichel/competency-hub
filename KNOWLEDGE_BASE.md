# ðŸ“˜ Knowledge Base â€“ Competency Tracking & Evaluation Platform

---

## 1. Project Description

This project is a **competency-based learning platform** designed to support three main personas:

- **Students (Bruno, 15 years old):** learn, track progress, access resources, complete evaluations, and showcase projects.
- **Educators (StÃ©phanie, 37 years old):** manage groups of children, validate competencies, add resources, generate reports, and communicate with parents.
- **Parents (Claude, 45 years old):** track their childâ€™s progress, communicate with educators, schedule meetings, and follow school life updates.

The platform provides a **learner-centered environment** with interactive dashboards, resource management, competency tracking, and communication features.

## 3. Interactions Between Objects

- **Students** navigate through Domain â†’ Competency â†’ Sub-Competency, access resources, attach projects, complete evaluations, and request validation.
- **Educators** validate competencies, add/edit resources, generate reports, and communicate with students/parents.
- **Parents** consult their childâ€™s progress (with blocked-but-visible competencies), schedule meetings, and follow school updates.
- **Resources** may require reservations with rules (time slots, duration, auto-expiry, visibility of who reserved).
- **Resource persons** (educators, peers, external adults) are linked directly to competencies and displayed with name & photo.
- **Learners** can add their own resources to competencies.
- **Progress tracking** is visual (color codes, pictograms, % progress, blocked-but-visible states).
- **Messaging** ensures communication across all stakeholders.
- **Reports** consolidate data for monitoring and communication.

## 5. Technical Approach

- **Frontend:** Vue3 + Quasar for responsive UI and component-based architecture.
- **Backend:** Amplify v2 (GraphQL API, Cognito auth, DynamoDB storage).
- **Testing:** Vitest for unit, integration, and component testing with coverage reporting.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for build, linting, testing, coverage, and deploy pipelines.
- **Quality gates:** automated PR checks, linting rules, and coverage thresholds.
