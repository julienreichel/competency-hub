# ðŸ“˜ Knowledge Base â€“ Competency Tracking & Evaluation Platform

---

## 1. Project Description

This project is a **competency-based learning platform** designed to support three main personas:

- **Students (Bruno, 7 years old):** learn, track progress, access resources, complete evaluations, and showcase projects.
- **Educators (StÃ©phanie, 37 years old):** manage groups of children, validate competencies, add resources, generate reports, and communicate with parents.
- **Parents (Claude, 45 years old):** track their childâ€™s progress, communicate with educators, schedule meetings, and follow school life updates.

The platform provides a **learner-centered environment** with interactive dashboards, resource management, competency tracking, and communication features.

## 3. Interactions Between Objects

- **Students** navigate through Domain â†’ Competency â†’ Sub-Competency, access resources, attach projects, complete evaluations, and request validation.
- **Educators** validate competencies, add/edit resources, generate reports, and communicate with students/parents.
- **Parents** consult their childâ€™s progress (with blocked-but-visible competencies), schedule meetings, and follow school updates.
- **Resources** may require reservations with rules (time slots, duration, auto-expiry, visibility of who reserved).
- **Resource persons** (educators, peers, external adults) are linked directly to competencies and displayed with name & photo.
- **Learners** can add their own resources to competencies.
- **Progress tracking** is visual (color codes, pictograms, % progress, blocked-but-visible states).
- **Messaging** ensures communication across all stakeholders.
- **Reports** consolidate data for monitoring and communication.

## 5. Technical Approach

- **Frontend:** Vue3 + Quasar for responsive UI and component-based architecture.
- **Backend:** Amplify v2 (GraphQL API, Cognito auth, DynamoDB storage).
- **Testing:** Vitest for unit, integration, and component testing with coverage reporting.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for build, linting, testing, coverage, and deploy pipelines.
- **Quality gates:** automated PR checks, linting rules, and coverage thresholds.

## 6. Proposed Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Foundations (Month 1-2)**

- Setup Amplify backend (Auth, GraphQL, DynamoDB)
- Configure Vue3 + Quasar + Vitest + GitHub Actions workflows
- Implement user management (login for Student/Educator/Parent)
- Build basic dashboards (Student & Educator home pages)

### **Phase 2: Core Learning Flow (Month 3-4)**

- Competency model (Domain â†’ Competency â†’ Sub-Competency)
- Student dashboard with progress visualization (color codes, %)
- Educator validation workflow
- Parent progress view (with blocked-visible competencies)
- Resource management (add/view/reserve resources, learner-added)

### **Phase 3: Collaboration & Tracking (Month 5-6)**

- Student projects (add, document, link competencies)
- Evaluations (catalog, booking, self/peer/adult modes)
- Learning focus definition & validation
- Proof upload for competencies

### **Phase 4: Communication & Reporting (Month 7-8)**

- Messaging (Educator â†” Parents, Educator â†” Team)
- School life (events, news, photo galleries with comments)
- Report generation (per child, PDF export, proofs included)

### **Phase 5: Polishing & Scalability (Month 9+)**
