# üìò Knowledge Base ‚Äì Competency Tracking & Evaluation Platform

---

## 1. Project Description

This project is a **competency-based learning platform** designed to support three main personas:

- **Students (Bruno, 7 years old):** learn, track progress, access resources, complete evaluations, and showcase projects.
- **Educators (St√©phanie, 37 years old):** manage groups of children, validate competencies, add resources, generate reports, and communicate with parents.
- **Parents (Claude, 45 years old):** track their child‚Äôs progress, communicate with educators, schedule meetings, and follow school life updates.

The platform provides a **learner-centered environment** with interactive dashboards, resource management, competency tracking, and communication features.

### **Phase 2: Core Learning Flow (Month 3-4)**

- Competency model (domain ‚Üí sub-domain ‚Üí competency)
- Student dashboard with progress visualization
- Educator validation workflow
- Parent progress view (without evaluations)
- Resource management (add/view/reserve resources)

### **Phase 3: Collaboration & Tracking (Month 5-6)**
